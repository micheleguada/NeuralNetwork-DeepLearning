# NeuralNetwork-DeepLearning
This repository contains the solutions to the assignments of the course Neural Networks and Deep Learning held at UNIPD, a.y. 2021-2022

The three assignment relates to three main topics in Deep Learning:  
> 1. **Homework 1** is about *Supervised Learning*, where we are asked to approximate a funtion using a Neural Network and to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier for the FashionMNIST dataset.  
> 2. **Homework 2** is about *Unsupervised Learning*, where we use a Convolutional Autoencoder to learn a latent representation of again the FashionMNIST dataset. We explore also the usage of Transfer Learning and of other flavours of the Autoencoder, in particular a Denoising and a Variational Autoencoder.
> 3. **Homework 3** is about *Reinforcement Learning*, where we train an agent to solve the CartPole problem from the OpenAI `gym` library, first using the environment state variables and then from raw pixels input.
