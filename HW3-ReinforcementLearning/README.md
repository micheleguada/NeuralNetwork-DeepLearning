## Homework 3 - Reinforcement Learning

Solution of the third homework of the course: NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING 2021/2022

The code is structured in the following way:  
> 1. **CartPole from state variables**: the first part of the task is implemented inside the notebook *Homework3-Part1_CartPole-v1.ipynb*. It contains the comparison of different exploration profiles and the hyper-parameters optimization for the agent trained on environment state variables.  
> 2. **CartPole from raw pixels**: the code of the second part is organized in a folder named *cartpolefrompixels* where all the needed tools and models to train the agent from pixels input are implemented. The main script is built inside the notebook *Homework3-Part2_CartPole-v1_Pixels.ipynb*.
